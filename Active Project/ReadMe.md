# Project: Automate Report Process

This project automates the end-to-end creation and delivery of a financial analytics report using Python. The system pulls real-time market data, processes it through a reproducible data pipeline, generates professional visualizations and risk metrics, and automatically emails a PDF report on a scheduled basis.

📌 **Project Status: Work in Progress**  
This notebook is part of an active portfolio analytics project and will be extended with risk metrics, visualizations, and automated reporting.
