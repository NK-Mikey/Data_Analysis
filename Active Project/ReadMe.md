# Project: Automate Report Process (WIP)

This project automates the end-to-end creation and delivery of a financial analytics report using Python. The system pulls real-time market data, processes it through a reproducible data pipeline, generates professional visualizations and risk metrics, and automatically emails a PDF report on a scheduled basis.

This project is work in progress status.
