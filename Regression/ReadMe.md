# LINEAR REGRESSION

This notebook uses a Simple Univariate Linear Regression to fit a line to the given data points. Linear regression models the relationship between one variable X and an output variable Y by finding the best-fitting straight line. We will apply Gradient Descent to iteratively update the line parameters θ0 and θ1 starting from zero, minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). The process stops once SSE is less than 0.5, ensuring the line closely fits the samples.
