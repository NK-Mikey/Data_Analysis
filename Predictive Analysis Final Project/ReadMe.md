# PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN USING ML MODELS

Customer churn continues to be a critical challenge in the banking industry, directly impacting revenue, customer lifetime value, and overall profitability. Since retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, banks must identify early indicators of dissatisfaction to prevent churn. This project addresses that need by developing machine learning models that can classify whether a customer is likely to leave based on historical account data and demographic attributes. Specifically, the project has three key objectives: first, to build and evaluate three supervised learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict churn; second, to identify the most influential features that drive customer churn decisions, using model-based insights such as feature importance and coefficients; and third, to explore how demographic factors like gender, geography and age correlate with churn behavior. Together, these efforts aim to provide banks with actionable, data-driven insights that support targeted customer retention strategies.
