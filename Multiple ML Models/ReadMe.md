# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR, DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION & LOGISTICS REGRESSION

In this notebook, we analyze a bank client dataset to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The task involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the application of machine learning models. Key steps include handling categorical variables, normalization, splitting the data, and building KNN, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models. Model performance is evaluated based on accuracy, offering insights into effective predictive modeling techniques in banking contexts.
