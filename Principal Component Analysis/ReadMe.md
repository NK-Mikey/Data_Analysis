# RFM vs PCA

This notebook involves applying two important customer analytics techniques: RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a transactional dataset of customer purchases. The task is to perform each method separately, interpret their results, and evaluate which technique is more effective for segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior.
