# CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION: RFM vs KMEANS

This project aimed to improve customer engagement strategies for a UK-based online retail company by identifying distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behaviors. Using the publicly available Online Retail dataset from UCI, we conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to profile customers and applied KMeans clustering to segment them into actionable groups. This dual approach enables the business to identify loyal customers, high-value spenders, and at-risk groups, thereby maximizing return on marketing investments through personalized engagement campaigns. Key findings show the presence of valuable customer groups like "Champions," "Loyal Customers," and "Big Spenders," as well as vulnerable segments like "At Risk" and "Lost." These insights can inform data-driven strategies such as loyalty rewards, win-back programs, and tailored marketing communication.
