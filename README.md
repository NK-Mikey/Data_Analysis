# 📊 Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio repository! This collection showcases a wide range of machine learning and data science techniques I have applied using Python and Power BI, Each project explores a different aspect of the data analytics workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to machine learning modeling, visualization, and business interpretation.
