# KMEANS CLUSTERING

This notebook demonstrates the application of the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customer data. We’ll walk through data preparation, model application, and a crucial method for determining the optimal number of clusters. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior — Recency, Frequency, and MonetaryValue — to enable targeted business strategies such as personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and churn prevention.
