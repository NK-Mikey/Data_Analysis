# DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION

A decision tree works by splitting the data based on feature values to make predictions, forming a tree-like structure. It is simple to understand, easy to visualize, and useful for making clear decisions. However, it can overfit the data if the tree becomes too complex, so careful evaluation is needed to ensure good performance on new data.
