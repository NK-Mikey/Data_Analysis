# SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE

Support Vector Machines are supervised learning models used for binary (and multi-class) classification. An SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates data points of different classes by focusing on the points (support vectors) closest to the boundary. This margin-maximizing approach often yields robust performance, especially in high-dimensional spaces, and can be extended to non-linear boundaries using kernel functions.
